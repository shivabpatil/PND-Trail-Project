To create MEAN stack based application for pick up and drop service of the bike. The
bike for servicing is picked up from the customer and it is dropped back to customer once
the servicing is done. Customer logs in and picks up the suitable time and date for pickup.
Once it is done he will fill the details the for the bike to be picked up and pickup address.
Once the request is created user can keep track of the pick up request and will get updates
accordingly. Customer can also buy the yearly package in that case he will gate 4 servicing
pick and drop and will not be charged in bill for it.

            The pick and drop person will fill the details for the bike on the spot to create
an job card. Once job card is created the mechanic is able to see the it and update it. The
default timer for 5 hr is set for servicing once the pick up is done. It can be changed in
some cases. The mechanic can update the parts if needed in job card. If part costs more
than 300 rs then an update is sent to customer. The part is updated only after customers
approval. Once the job card is completed the bill is created with pick up and drop charges
included in it. Once bill is paid the order is archived and the servicing request for after
next 3 month is created.

The schedule for pick and drop is created automatically and it is optimized using algorithm.
Then login for pickup and drop persons is also maintained. The status of pickup vehicle is
also maintained. The pickups are assigned to relative person and the status of it can be
only be changed by that person only. If pickup is canceled it gets rescheduled if needed.

The manger can see the reports created for the all requests. Also bale to see number of pickup
done by single person. Over all performance of each department and also the finance. Daily
money flow, profit loss. Manager can also fill the relative information for the available
service center and rate card. Also the all the working persons.

Admin can create logins for pickup and drop persons and also for manager. Also can
maintain the user logins. Can check the load on servers and the network can reset the
password for database and other important details.
